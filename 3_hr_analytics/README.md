# Optimise personnel management

## Project Description
HR analysts help businesses optimise their HR management: the business provides the data and the analysts suggest how to avoid financial losses and employee churn. The company provided data with the characteristics of the company's employees. 

## Goals
- The first is to build a model that can predict the level of employee satisfaction based on customer data. 
- The second is to build a model that can predict, based on customer data, that an employee will leave the company.
