# Data Science Projects - Yandex Education (2023-2024)

Welcome to my repository where I document all the projects I have completed as part of the Data Science program by Yandex. This includes both mini-projects completed after each topic and the final projects at the end of each module.

## Program Structure

The program is divided into four main modules, each focusing on different aspects of Data Science.

### Module 1: Foundations of Python and Data Analysis
- **Basic Python**: 18 September – 24 September
- **Data Processing**: 2 October – 8 October
- **Research Data Analysis**: 16 October – 22 October
- **Statistical Data Analysis**: 30 October – 5 November
- **Comprehensive Project - 1**: 13 November – 19 November

### Module 2: Advanced Modeling Techniques
- **Linear Models in Machine Learning**: 27 November – 3 December
- **Teacher Quality: Model Training**: 18 December – 24 December
- **Final Project - 2**: 15 January – 21 January

### Module 3: Business Applications and SQL
- **Machine Learning in Business**: 29 January – 4 February
- **Basic SQL**: 12 February – 18 February
- **Numerical Methods**: 4 March – 10 March
- **Time Series**: 11 March – 17 March

### Module 4: Text Analysis and Unsupervised Learning
- **Machine Learning for Texts**: 25 March – 31 March

## Mini-Projects

After each educational topic, I have completed a mini-project to apply the concepts learned. These are smaller in scope but are critical for reinforcing the learning materials.

## Final Projects

At the end of each module, I have undertaken a comprehensive project that synthesizes the module's content. These projects are more extensive and include a variety of Data Science techniques and methodologies.
